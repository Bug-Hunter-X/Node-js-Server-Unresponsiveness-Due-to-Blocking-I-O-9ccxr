# Node.js Server Unresponsiveness Due to Blocking I/O

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js where a server becomes unresponsive due to blocking I/O operations within request handlers.  The provided code simulates a long-running task, causing the server to hang and not respond to subsequent requests.

The solution showcases how to avoid this issue by using asynchronous programming techniques (e.g., using `setTimeout` to simulate an asynchronous task) or by offloading intensive tasks to worker threads.  This ensures that the server's event loop remains responsive to other incoming requests.
